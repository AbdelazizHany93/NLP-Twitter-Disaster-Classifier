# NLP-Twitter-Disaster-Classifier


 This project is centered on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze social media data, specifically tweets, to distinguish between those that are related to natural disasters and those that are not.
The objective is to preprocess the text in tweets, apply NLP techniques for analysis, and then use machine learning models to classify each tweet.

The aim is to demonstrate how NLP and machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, such as enhancing disaster response mechanisms through the analysis of social media.
